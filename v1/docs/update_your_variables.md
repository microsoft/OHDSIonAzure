# Updating your Variable Groups

You can update your [variable groups](/docs/update_your_variables.md/#updating-your-variable-groups) to reflect your environment.

The [bootstrap Terraform project](/infra/terraform/bootstrap/README.md/#setup-azure-devops) will setup [Azure DevOps Variable Groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/variable-groups?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml) in your environment, including:

* Two (2) variable groups for environment setup:
    1. A variable group ending with [bootstrap-vg](/docs/update_your_variables.md/#1-bootstrap-vg) which is linked to [Azure Key Vault secrets](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/variable-groups?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml#link-secrets-from-an-azure-key-vault) to run with your Environment Pipeline
    2. A variable group ending with [bootstrap-settings-vg](/docs/update_your_variables.md/#2-bootstrap-settings-vg) which is **not** linked to Azure Key Vault to configure running your Environment pipeline
* One (1) variable group ending with [omop-environment-settings-vg](/docs/update_your_variables.md/#3-omop-environment-settings-vg) for application pipelines per environment

You can of course work with your administrator to modify the [terraform](/infra/terraform/bootstrap/main.tf) to reflect desired changes, and you can also look to update some of the settings in Azure DevOps once the variable groups are made available.

## Prerequisites

1. You will need to access a successfully completed Dev Environment based on the [infrastructure setup](/infra/README.md).

## Variable Groups

You can review how the variable groups are used in the following sections.

### 1. Bootstrap VG

This variable group (ending in `bootstrap-vg`) will pick up [Azure Key Vault secrets](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/variable-groups?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml#link-secrets-from-an-azure-key-vault) which will then be used by the [Environment Pipeline](/pipelines/README.md/#environment-pipeline).
